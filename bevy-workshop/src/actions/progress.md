# Progress Report

## What You've Learned

* How Z-Index works in 2d: higher values are in front
* How to implement reactivity
    * By using [`Trigger`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.15.0-rc.2/bevy/ecs/observer/struct.Trigger.html) and observers
    * Or with optional components to change how an existing query behaves

## Going Further

* Using [`Component` hooks](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.15.0-rc.2/bevy/ecs/component/trait.Component.html#adding-components-hooks) to react when a component is added/changed or removed.
