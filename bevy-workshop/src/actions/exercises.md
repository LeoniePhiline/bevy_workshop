## Use Fixed Z Indexes

Use fixed values for the z indexes so that the game renders the same every time.

Tips:
* Look for every `from_xyz` and replace the third value by a different index
* Ground in the back, then flag, then player in the front

## PowerUps

Add an item to pick up that change how the player jumps.

## Switches

Add a switch zone that enables something else in the level.
