# Introduction to Bevy

We'll start our game with a splash screen. To achieve this, we will:
* Create a new Bevy application
* Add the default plugins
* Build a system to spawn entities with components
* Use states to reduce boilerplate code
* Refactor our code using plugins

Checkout the branch:

```sh
git checkout 05-intro-to-bevy
```
