# Camera Management

## Follow the player

## Lookahead

Offset the camera in the forward direction: dedicate more of the screen to where the player is going

## Don't follow on the Y axis

On the Y axis, don't follow the player when they jump. Instead, follow when they land on a platform so that the ground is always at the same level.

## Damping

Don't move the camera as soon as the player moves, but as if it was bound to the player by an elastic

## Screen Shake and Juice

Fun effect when something happens
