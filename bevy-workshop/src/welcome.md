# Welcome

This is an introduction workshop for the [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org).

At the end, you should have an overview of how Bevy works, and a simple 2d platformer.

## Target Audience

This workshop is for people wanting to get a better understanding of Bevy basics, with already a good understanding of Rust.

This workshop won't use any third party plugins, and won't go very deep into rendering.
